The News Bytes mobile application for aggregating daily news.

## Branching
- `main` - production version of the application, no direct commits to main branch, only merges from dev
- `dev` - stable development branch, used for creating new feature, bug, or developer branches and for changes in those branches to be merged back in
- `<DEV_FIRSTNAME>_dev` (developer branch) - development branches for isolating changes by dev
- `<FEATURE_NAME>_feature` (feature branch) - branch targeted to a specific feature
- `<BUG_NAME>_bug` (bug branch) - branch targeted to a specific bug
